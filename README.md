## Running the App

### ImGui Setup

The app uses the Odin ImGui bindings: [**gitlab.com/L-4/odin-imgui**](https://gitlab.com/L-4/odin-imgui)  

To set up ImGui, clone the repository into your Odin shared folder and build it with the following backend options:

```
wanted_backends = ["opengl3", "glfw"]
```

### FastNoise Lite Odin Package

The app uses the FNL Odin port: [**github.com/itsdanott/fast-noise-lite-odin**](github.com/itsdanott/fast-noise-lite-odin)

Copy the FastNoiseLite.odin file to a fast_noise_lite directory inside your Odin shared folder.
